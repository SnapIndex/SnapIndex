Introduction\\nThe rapid rise of Language Models (LMs) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] marks a transformative era in artificial intelligence,\\nwith these models demonstrating exceptional accuracy across a broad range of tasks. However, their efficiency\\nhas become a significant concern due to the substantial computational and memory demands they impose.\\nThis issue is particularly pronounced in long-context generation and reasoning, where the self-attention\\nmechanism [8] incurs a computational complexity of𝑂(𝑛2) and generates a large Key-Value (KV) cache1.\\nTo address this challenge, substantial efforts have been dedicated to designing more efficient LM architectures\\nby developing attention mechanisms with reduced𝑂(𝑛) complexity [9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]. In parallel, significant\\n1We refer to the standard𝑂(𝑛2) attention as full attention, and𝑂(𝑛) attention as linear attention.\\nCorresponding author(s): Han Cai (hcai@nvidia.com).\\n© 2025 NVIDIA.

It then performs a coarse-to-fine search for efficient attention block designs, first determining the\\noptimal placement of full-attention layers, then selecting the best linear attention block or using a new linear\\nattention block, and finally searching for optimal architectural hyperparameters.\\nwork has focused on constructing hybrid models that combine full and linear attention to strike a balance\\nbetween accuracy and efficiency [15, 16, 17]. While these models offer improved efficiency over full-attention\\narchitectures, their accuracy still significantly falls behind state-of-the-art (SOTA) full-attention models,\\nparticularly on challenging benchmarks such as MMLU(-Pro) [18, 19], mathematical reasoning [20, 21, 22],\\nretrieval [23, 24, 25], coding [26, 27, 28], and long-context tasks [29].\\nThis paper introduces Jet-Nemotron, a new family of LMs that matches the accuracy of SOTA full-attention\\nmodels while delivering exceptional efficiency. Figure 1 compares Jet-Nemotron with previous efficient LMs.\\nNotably, Jet-Nemotron-2B achieves higher accuracy on MMLU-Pro than Qwen3-1.7B-Base [5], while offering\\n47×higher generation throughput on the NVIDIA H100 GPU under a context length of 64K.\\nJet-Nemotron is built upon Post Neural Architecture Search (PostNAS), a novel neural architecture exploration\\npipeline (Figure 2) that enables the rapid design of efficient model architectures. Unlike the mainstream LM\\narchitecture design approaches, PostNAS begins with a pre-trained full-attention model, from which it inherits\\nthe Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) weights and keeps them frozen throughout the process. This strategy\\nsignificantly reduces training costs while still allowing for comprehensive exploration of the attention block.\\nThe pipeline then proceeds through four key steps to systematically search for optimal attention block designs.\\ni) Full Attention Placement and Elimination.Retaining a few full-attention layers within the model\\n[30] is essential for maintaining high accuracy on challenging tasks such as retrieval. However, the optimal\\nplacement of these layers remains unclear. In Section 2.2, we introduce a novel approach that automatically\\nlearns where to use full-attention layers by training a once-for-all super network [31] (Figure 4). The resulting\\nlearned placement significantly outperforms the commonly used uniform placement strategy in terms of\\naccuracy on MMLU (Figure 5, right).\\nii) Linear Attention Block Selection.After finalizing the placement of full-attention layers, we conduct\\nan attention block search to identify the optimal linear attention block (Section 2.3). Thanks to the low\\ntraining cost of our framework, we can systematically evaluate existing linear attention blocks in terms of\\naccuracy across diverse tasks, training efficiency, and inference speed. Importantly, our approach eliminates\\nthe need to rely on small proxy tasks, such as training tiny LMs (e.g., 50M or 150M parameters), ensuring\\nthat the search results directly translate to improvements in final model accuracy. Moreover, as new linear\\nattention blocks are out, our framework can rapidly evaluate them against prior designs and adopt them if\\nthey demonstrate promising results.\\niii) New Attention Block Design.Our framework also facilitates the rapid design of new attention blocks.\\nAdding convolutions is a widely used strategy to enhance the capacity of linear attention [32]. However, prior\\nmethods rely solely on static convolution kernels, lacking the ability to dynamically adapt convolution kernels’\\nfeature extraction patterns. In Section 2.4, we introduce a new linear attention block, JetBlock (Figure 2,\\n#3). JetBlock uses a kernel generator to produce dynamic causal convolution kernels conditioned on the\\ninput, which are then applied to the value (V) tokens. Additionally, it removes redundant static convolutions\\non the query (Q) and key (K), streamlining the computation. Compared with prior linear attention blocks,\\n2'},\n",

Last, in Section 2.5, we introduce a hardware-aware\\narchitecture search to identify optimal architectural hyperparameters. Traditionally, the number of parameters\\nhas been used as a proxy for LM efficiency. However, parameter count does not directly correlate with\\ngeneration efficiency on actual hardware. Our hardware-aware search discovers architectural hyperparameters\\nthat deliver similar generation throughput, while using more parameters to achieve better accuracy (Table 2).\\nWe evaluate Jet-Nemotron across a comprehensive suite of benchmarks, including MMLU(-Pro) [18, 19],\\ncommonsense reasoning [33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38], mathematical reasoning [20, 21, 22, 39], retrieval [23, 24, 25],\\ncoding [26, 27, 28, 40], and long-context tasks [29]. Our Jet-Nemotron-2B model matches or surpasses SOTA\\nfull-attention models, such as Qwen2.5 [4], Qwen3 [5], Gemma3 [41, 42] and Llama3.2 [2], across all benchmarks,\\nwhile achieving significantly higher generation throughput. Furthermore, the throughput gains are even more\\nsubstantial in long-context settings (Figure 6). For example, with a 256K context length, Jet-Nemotron-2B\\ndelivers a 6.14×prefilling speedup and a 53.6×decoding speedup compared to Qwen3-1.7B-Base. We hope\\nthat our efficient LM family (Jet-Nemotron), our new linear attention block (JetBlock), and our architecture\\ndesign pipeline (PostNAS) will benefit the community and accelerate the development and deployment of\\nnext-generation efficient LMs. We summarize our main contributions below:\\n• We introduce PostNAS, a novel model architecture exploration paradigm for language models. By reusing\\npre-trained LLMs, PostNAS reduces the cost and risk associated with LLM architecture exploration,\\nenabling faster and more efficient innovation in the architecture design of LMs.\\n• We offer novel insights into the architecture design of efficient LMs, such as the task-specific importance\\nof attention layers and the finding that KV cache size is a more critical factor than parameter count for\\ngeneration throughput.\\n• We introduce a novel linear attention block, JetBlock, which integrates linear attention with dynamic\\nconvolution and hardware-aware architecture search. It consistently delivers significant accuracy\\nimprovements over previous linear attention blocks while maintaining comparable generation throughput.\\n• We introduce Jet-Nemotron, a novel hybrid-architecture LM family that achieves superior accuracy\\nacross a wide range of tasks and offers significantly higher generation throughput than prior SOTA\\nfull-attention models (e.g., Qwen2.5, Qwen3, Gemma3, and Llama3.2). With its strong accuracy and\\nexceptional inference efficiency, Jet-Nemotron offers practical benefits for various applications requiring\\nefficient LMs.\\n2. Method\\n2.1. PostNAS Motivation and Roadmap\\nDesigning new language model architectures is challenging and risky due to the high cost of pre-training.\\nMoreover, the significant gap in computational resources and training data makes it difficult for researchers\\noutside of major organizations to match the accuracy of state-of-the-art full-attention models developed by\\nlarge industry players [4, 41, 2]. This disparity hinders innovation in language model architecture design.\\nThis paper proposes an alternative strategy for developing new language model architectures. Rather than\\npre-training models from scratch, we explore novel architectures by building on top of existing full-attention\\nmodels. This approach dramatically reduces both training costs and data requirements.\\n3'},\n",

First, as demonstrated in Figure 1, they can deliver immediate\\ngains in efficiency and accuracy over state-of-the-art full-attention models, translating to practical benefits\\nsuch as improved services and reduced operational costs. Second, our framework serves as a rapid testbed for\\narchitectural innovation. If a new design fails to perform well in this setting, it will be unlikely to succeed\\nin full pre-training [43]. This filtering mechanism helps researchers avoid wasting substantial computational\\nresources on unpromising designs.\\nFigure 2 illustrates the roadmap of PostNAS. Starting from a pre-trained full-attention model, it freezes\\nthe MLP weights and explores attention block designs in a coarse-to-fine manner through four key steps:\\nfull attention placement and elimination (Section 2.2), linear attention block selection (Section 2.3), new\\nattention block design (Section 2.4), and hardware-aware architecture search (Section 2.5). Figure 3 shows\\nthe accuracy improvement breakdown from these steps. We observe substantial accuracy improvements across\\nall benchmarks: +5.3 on MMLU, +8.4 on math, +7.8 on retrieval, and +3.2 on commonsense reasoning.\\n2.2. Full Attention Placement and Elimination\\nIncorporating a few full-attention layers has become a common strategy for improving accuracy [30, 16, 44, 17].\\nThe standard approach applies full attention uniformly across a fixed subset of layers, with the remaining\\nlayers using linear attention. However, this uniform strategy is suboptimal, especially in our setting, where we\\nbegin with a pre-trained full-attention model.\\nTo address this, we propose an automatic method for efficiently determining the placement of full-attention\\nlayers. The overall approach is illustrated in Figure 4. We construct a once-for-all super network [45, 31] by\\naugmenting the pre-trained full-attention model with alternative linear attention paths.

The search objective is task-dependent: for MMLU,\\nwe select the configuration with the lowest loss on the correct answer (i.e., maximizing−𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠), while for\\nmathematical and retrieval tasks, we choose the one with the highest accuracy. As shown in Figure 5(b),\\nPostNAS significantly outperforms uniform placement in terms of accuracy.\\nFigure 5(a) presents the search results for Qwen2.5-1.5B. For each layer, we extract the corresponding\\nsubnetwork from the super network by configuring that layer as full attention while setting all remaining\\nlayers to linear attention. We evaluate the accuracy or loss of each subnetwork on a given task and visualize\\nthe results using a heatmap. Our analysis reveals three key findings:\\nKey Finding 1:In the pre-trained full-attention model, not all attention layers contribute equally.\\nFor MMLU, only two layers exhibit critical importance, while for retrieval tasks, just two to three\\nlayers are particularly crucial.\\nKey Finding 2:Different attention layers contribute to different capabilities. Layers that are critical\\nfor MMLU accuracy are not necessarily important for retrieval tasks.\\nKey Finding 3:The pattern of attention importance becomes more intricate for complex tasks like\\nmathematical reasoning. Fortunately, the combined set of top critical layers identified for MMLU and\\nretrieval already encompasses most of the key layers needed for math.\\nIn addition to these key findings, we observe that the search results remain consistent when using different\\nlinear attention operations. In our final experiments, we use GLA [11] in the once-for-all super network\\ntraining for simplicity and slightly improved training throughput.\\n2.3. Linear Attention Block Selection\\nBuilding on the discovered full-attention layer placement, we conduct an attention block search to identify the\\nmost suitable linear attention block for our setup. In our experiments, we evaluate six SOTA linear attention\\nblocks, including RWKV7 [10], RetNet [12], Mamba2 [50], GLA [11], Deltanet [51], and Gated DeltaNet [32].\\nAfter initial efficiency profiling, we observe that RWKV7 exhibits significantly lower training throughput\\ncompared to other linear attention blocks, possibly due to suboptimal kernel implementation. Consequently,\\nwe exclude it from our training experiments. The results, summarized in Table 1, indicate that Gated DeltaNet\\nachieves the best overall accuracy among the evaluated linear attention blocks. This is attributed to the\\ncombination of two factors: (1) the Data-Dependent Gating Mechanism [52], which dynamically controls\\nwhether the model should focus more on the current token or the history state, and (2) the Delta Rule [53],\\nwhich updates the history state with the information increment from the current token, to save the limited\\nstate memory. Therefore, we proceed with Gated DeltaNet in our experiments.\\n2.4. New Attention Block Design\\nWe propose a new linear attention block, JetBlock, designed to enhance the model’s expressive power by\\nincorporating dynamic convolution [54, 55] into linear attention. Convolution has been shown to be essential\\nfor achieving strong accuracy in many linear attention blocks [32, 56]. However, prior works typically use\\nstatic convolution kernels, which cannot adapt their feature extraction patterns based on the input.\\nTo address this limitation, we introduce a kernel generator module that dynamically produces convolution\\nkernels based on the input features. The overall structure is shown in Figure 2 (#3). This module shares the\\nsame input as the Q/K/V projection layer and begins with a linear reduction layer to improve efficiency, using\\na reduction ratio of 8. A SiLU activation function [57] is applied, followed by a final linear layer that outputs\\n5'},\n",

When the KV cache size is constant, models with different parameter counts exhibit\\nsimilar generation throughput (Table 2).\\nThis is because the decoding stage is typically memory-bandwidth-bound rather than compute-bound. In\\nlong-context scenarios, the KV cache often consumes more memory than the model weights. Reducing its size\\ndecreases memory transfer time per decoding step and enables a larger batch size, thereby improving the\\ngeneration throughput.\\nBased on Finding 4, we fix the KV cache size to match the original design and conduct a small-scale grid\\nsearch over the key dimension, value dimension, and number of attention heads. Table 2 summarizes the\\nresults, where all variants use the same linear attention block (i.e., Gated DeltaNet) but have different\\nconfigurations. The blue row represents our final design, while the gray row corresponds to the original design.\\nOur final configuration achieves a generation throughput comparable to the original while incorporating more\\nparameters and improving accuracy. From Table 1, we can see that our hardware-aware search in PostNAS\\nboosts the JetBlock’s accuracy, while maintaining training and inference throughput.\\n3. Experiments\\n3.1. Setup\\nJet-Nemotron Model Family.We construct two versions of Jet-Nemotron with different parameter sizes:\\nJet-Nemotron-2B and Jet-Nemotron-4B. We use the Retrieval task to guide the placement of full attention\\nlayers and the MMLU task to guide the placement of sliding window attention (SWA) layers. Jet-Nemotron-2B\\nis built upon Qwen2.5-1.5B [4], incorporating two full-attention layers (No. 15 and 20) for retrieval tasks and\\ntwo sliding window attention (SWA) layers (No. 21 and 22) for multiple-choice tasks like MMLU. We find\\nmultiple-choice tasks mainly rely on the pattern-matching property of the softmax operation to route the\\nknowledge of answers to their options. SWA effectively preserves the accuracy on such tasks. The remaining\\nattention layers are replaced with JetBlock.

Related Work\\nLarge language models (LLMs) are powerful but computationally intensive, motivating many works to build\\nefficient model architectures for LLMs. One line of research focuses on designing efficient linear attention\\nblocks [9, 10, 11, 12, 32, 50, 51, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 82, 84] or log-linear attention [85] blocks\\nto replace full attention blocks. Orthogonally, another line of research tries to combine full attention and linear\\nattention to build hybrid models [13, 15, 16, 17, 44, 86, 87, 88]. These works typically focus on the pre-training\\nsetting, and their accuracy lags behind leading full-attention models. Recently, there are some efforts on\\nlinearizing LLMs with full attention replaced with linear attention [89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]. However,\\ntheir model architecture are poorly optimized due to the large overhead of evaluating specific configuration,\\nand thus their results are still inferior to SOTA full-attention models.\\nOur work is also related to neural architecture search (NAS) [45, 97, 98, 99, 100], a powerful technique for\\nexploring the architectural design space and discovering novel model structures. In particular, hardware-aware\\nneural architecture search [45] enables the development of specialized model architectures optimized for target\\nhardware by training a once-for-all super-network [31], or leveraging layer-wise distillation [101, 102], etc.\\nHowever, NAS has been rarely applied in the era of large language models (LLMs) due to the prohibitive cost\\nof pretraining. Recent efforts have primarily focused on building flexible LLM architectures [103, 104], which\\ncan generate a range of subnetworks with varying depths and widths to accommodate different hardware\\nplatforms. Nevertheless, the architectural backbone of these subnetworks remains unchanged, relying entirely\\non full-attention layers.\\n5. Conclusion\\nWe introduce Jet-Nemotron, a new family of hybrid-architecture language models that outperform state-of-the-\\nart full-attention models — including Qwen3, Qwen2.5, Gemma3, and Llama3.2 — while delivering substantial\\nefficiency gains, with up to 53.6×higher generation throughput on H100 GPUs (256K context length,\\nmaximum batch size). Jet-Nemotron is enabled by two key innovations: (1) Post Neural Architecture Search,\\na highly efficient post-training architecture adaptation pipeline applicable to any pre-trained Transformer\\nmodel; and (2) the JetBlock, a novel linear attention block that significantly outperforms prior designs such\\nas Mamba2, GLA, and Gated DeltaNet. Extensive empirical results show that Jet-Nemotron achieves major\\nefficiency improvements without compromising accuracy across a broad range of benchmarks. Additionally,\\nJet-Nemotron significantly reduces the cost and risk associated with LLM architecture exploration, enabling\\nfaster and more efficient innovation in language model design.\\n11'},\n",

The reported GPU hours already account for the total number of devices.\\nA.3. Throughput Measurement\\nThroughout the experiments, we measure the maximum reachable prefilling and decoding throughput of\\nJet-Nemotron and the baselines on a single H100 GPU. This is achieved by adjusting the chunk size in\\nchunk-prefilling [72] to maximize the decoding batch size without sacrificing the prefilling throughput. We list\\nthe optimized batch size and the corresponding chunk size for each model in Table 13. The prefilling context\\nlength is 64K. Since the KV cache memory dominates GPU usage during inference, by reducing the memory\\nfootprint per sequence, smaller caches allow more sequences to be processed in parallel, greatly boosting\\ngeneration throughput.\\n18'},\n",
